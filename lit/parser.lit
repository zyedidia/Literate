@s Introduction

This is an implementation of a literate programming system in D.
The goal is to be able to create books that one can read on a website,
with chapters, subchapters, and sections, and additionally to be able
to compile the code from the book into a working program.

Literate proogramming aims to make the source code of a program
understandable. The program can be structured in any way the
programmer likes, and the code should be explained.

The source code for a literate program will somewhat resemble
CWEB, but differ in many key ways which simplify the source code
and make it easier to read. Literate will use @ signs for commands
and markdown to style the prose. 

@s Directory Structure

A Literate program may be just a single file, but it should also be
possible to make a book out of it, with chapters and possibly multiple
programs in a single book. If the literate command line tool is run on
a single file, it should compile that file, if it is run on a directory,
it should search for the `Summary.lit` file in the directory and create a
book.

What should the directory structure of a Literate book look like?
I try to mimic the [Gitbook](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook) software
here. There will be a `Summary.lit` file which links to each of the
different chapters in the book. An example `Summary.lit` file might look
like this:

    @title Title of the book
    
    [Chapter 1](chapter1/intro.lit)
        [Subchapter 1](chapter1/example1.lit)
        [Subchapter 2](chapter1/example2.lit)
    [Chapter 2](section2/intro.lit)
        [Subchapter 1](chapter2/example1.lit)

Sub chapters are denoted by tabs, and each chapter is linked to the correct
`.lit` file using Markdown link syntax.

@s The Parser

As a first step, I'll make a parser for single chapters only, and leave having
multiple chapters and books for later.

The parser will have 2 main parts to it: the which represent the various structures
in a literate program, and the parse function.

--- parser.d
@{Imports}
@{Classes}
@{Parse functions}
---

I'll quickly list the imports here.

--- Imports
import globals;
import std.stdio;
import util;
import std.string: split, endsWith, startsWith, chomp, replace, strip, format;
import std.algorithm: canFind;
import std.regex: matchAll, matchFirst, regex, ctRegex, splitter;
import std.conv;
import std.path: extension;
import std.file;
---

@s

Now we have to define the classes used to represent a literate program. There
are 7 such classes:

--- Classes
@{Line class}
@{Command class}
@{Block class}
@{Section class}
@{Chapter class}
@{Program class}
@{Change class}
---

@s The Program Class

What is a literate program at the highest level? A program has multiple chapters,
it has a title, and it has various commands associated with it (although some of these
commands may be overwritten by chapters or even sections). It also has the file it
originally came from.

--- Program class
class Program {
    public string title;
    public Command[] commands;
    public Chapter[] chapters;
    public string file;
    public string text;

    this() {
        commands = [];
        chapters = [];
    }
}
---

@s The Chapter class

A chapter is very similar to a program. It has a title, commands, sections, and also
an original file. In the case of a single file program (which is what we are focusing
on for the moment) the Program's file and the Chapter's file will be the same. A chapter
also has a minor number and a major number;

--- Chapter class
class Chapter {
    public string title;
    public Command[] commands;
    public Section[] sections;
    public string file;

    public int majorNum;
    public int minorNum;

    this() {
        commands = [];
        sections = [];
    }

    string num() {
        if (minorNum != 0) {
            return to!string(majorNum) ~ "." ~ to!string(minorNum);
        } else {
            return to!string(majorNum);
        }
    }
}
---

@s The Sections class

A section has a title, commands, a number, and a series of blocks, which can either be
blocks of code, or blocks of prose.

--- Section class
class Section {
    public string title;
    public Command[] commands;
    public Block[] blocks;
    public int num;

    this() {
        commands = [];
        blocks = [];
    }
}
---

@s The Block Class

A block is more interesting. It can either be a block of code, or a block of prose, so
it has a boolean which represents what type it is. It also stores a start line. If it
is a code block, it also has a name. Finally, it stores an array of lines, and has a function
called `text()` which just returns the string of the text it contains. A block also contains
a `codeType` and a `commentString`.

--- Block class
class Block {
    public Line startLine;
    public string name;
    public bool isCodeblock;
    public bool isRootBlock;
    public Line[] lines;

    public string codeType;
    public string commentString;

    public Modifier[] modifiers;

    this() {
        lines = [];
        modifiers = [];
    }

    string text() {
        string text = "";
        foreach (line; lines) {
            text ~= line.text ~ "\n";
        }
        return text;
    }

    Block dup() {
        Block b = new Block();
        b.startLine = startLine;
        b.name = name;
        b.isCodeblock = isCodeblock;
        b.codeType = codeType;
        b.commentString = commentString;
        b.modifiers = modifiers;

        foreach (Line l; lines) {
            b.lines ~= l.dup();
        }

        return b;
    }
}
---

@s The Command Class

A command is quite simple. It has a name, and any arguments that are passed.

--- Command class
class Command {
    public string name;
    public string args;
    public int lineNum;
    public string filename;
    this() {}
}
---

@s The Line Class

A line is the lowest level. It stores the line number, the file the line is from, and the
text for the line itself.

--- Line class
class Line {
    public string file;
    public int lineNum;
    public string text;

    this(string text, string file, int lineNum) {
        this.text = text;
        this.file = file;
        this.lineNum = lineNum;
    }

    Line dup() {
        return new Line(text, file, lineNum);
    }
}
---

@s The Change Class

The change class helps when parsing a change statement. It stores the file that is being changed,
what the text to search for is and what the text to replace it with is. These two things are arrays
because you can make multiple changes (search and replaces) to one file. In order to
keep track of the current change, an index is also stored.

--- Change class
class Change {
    public string filename;
    public string[] searchText;
    public string[] replaceText;
    public int index;

    this() {
        searchText = [];
        replaceText = [];
        index = 0;
    }
}
---

That's it for the classes. These 7 classes can be used to represent an entire literate program.
Now let's get to the actual parse function to turn a text file into a program.

@s The Parse Function

Here we have two functions: `parseProgram` and `parseChapter`.

--- Parse functions
@{parseProgram function}
@{parseChapter function}
---

@s parseProgram function

This function takes a literate book source and parses each chapter and returns the final program.

Here is an example book:

    @title Title of the book

    [Chapter 1](chapter1/intro.lit)
        [Subchapter 1](chapter1/example1.lit)
        [Subchapter 2](chapter1/example2.lit)
    [Chapter 2](section2/intro.lit)
        [Subchapter 1](chapter2/example1.lit)

--- parseProgram function
Program parseProgram(Program p, string src) {
    string filename = p.file;
    bool hasChapters;

    string[] lines = src.split("\n");
    int lineNum;
    int majorNum;
    int minorNum;
    foreach (line; lines) {
        lineNum++;

        if (line.startsWith("@title")) {
            p.title = strip(line[6..$]);
        } else if (line.startsWith("@book")) {
            continue;
        } else if (auto matches = matchFirst(line, regex(r"\[(?P<chapterName>.*)\]\((?P<filepath>.*)\)"))) {
            if (matches["filepath"] == "") {
                error(filename, lineNum, "No filepath for " ~ matches["chapterName"]);
                continue;
            }
            if (leadingWS(line).length > 0) {
                minorNum++;
            } else {
                majorNum++;
                minorNum = 0;
            }
            Chapter c = new Chapter();
            c.file = matches["filepath"];
            c.title = matches["chapterName"];
            c.majorNum = majorNum;
            c.minorNum = minorNum;

            p.chapters ~= parseChapter(c, readall(File(matches["filepath"])));
            hasChapters = true;
        } else {
            p.text ~= line ~ "\n";
        }
    }

    return p;
}
---

@s parseChapter function

The `parseChapter` function is the more complex one. It parses the source of a chapter.
Before doing any parsing, we resolve the `@include` statements by replacing them with
the contents of the file that was included. Then we loop through each line in the source
and parse it, provided that it is not a comment (starting with `//`);

--- parseChapter function
Chapter parseChapter(Chapter chapter, string src) {
    @{Initialize some variables}

    string[] blocks = [];

    string include(string file) {
        if (file == filename) {
            error(filename, 1, "Recursive include");
            return "";
        }
        if (!exists(file)){
            error(filename, 1, "File " ~ file ~ " does not exist");
            return "";
        }
        return readall(File(file));
    }

    // Handle the @include statements
    /* src = std.regex.replaceAll!(match => include(match[1]))(src, regex(`\n@include (.*)`)); */
    string[] linesStr = src.split("\n");
    Line[] lines;
    foreach (lineNum, line; linesStr) {
        lines ~= new Line(line, filename, cast(int) lineNum+1);
    }

    for (int j = 0; j < lines.length; j++) {
        auto lineObj = lines[j];
        filename = lineObj.file;
        auto lineNum = lineObj.lineNum;
        auto line = lineObj.text;

        if (strip(line).startsWith("//") && !inCodeblock) {
            continue;
        }

        @{Parse the line}
    }
    @{Close the last section}

    return chapter;
}
---

@s The Parse Function Setup

For the initial variables, it would be nice to move the value for `chapter.file` into a variable
called `filename`. Additionally, I'm going to need an array of all the possible commands that
are recognized.

--- Initialize some variables
string filename = chapter.file;
string[] commands = ["@code_type", "@comment_type", "@compiler", "@error_format", 
                     "@add_css", "@overwrite_css", "@colorscheme", "@include"];
---

I also need to keep track of the current section that is being parsed, and the current block that
is being parsed, because the parser is going through the file one line at a time. I'll also define
the current change being parsed.

--- Initialize some variables +=
Section curSection;
int sectionNum = 0;
Block curBlock;
Change curChange;
---

Finally, I need 3 flags to keep track of if it is currently parsing a codeblock, a search block,
or a replace block.

--- Initialize some variables +=
bool inCodeblock = false;
bool inSearchBlock = false;
bool inReplaceBlock = false;
---

@s Parsing the Line

When parsing a line, we are either inside a code block, or inside a prose block, or we are transitioning
from one to the other. So we'll have an if statement to separate the two.

--- Parse the line
if (!inCodeblock) {
    // This might be a change block
    @{Parse change block}
    @{Parse a command}
    @{Parse a title command}
    @{Parse a section definition}
    @{Parse the beginning of a code block}
    else if (curBlock !is null) {
        if (line.split().length > 1) {
            if (commands.canFind(line.split()[0])) {
                continue;
            }
        }
        @{Add the line to the list of lines}
    }
} else if (startsWith(line, "---")) {
    @{Begin a new prose block}
} else if (curBlock !is null) {
    @{Add the line to the list of lines}
}
---

Parsing a command and the title command are both fairly simple, so let's look at them first.

To parse a command we first make sure that there is the command name, and any arguments.
Then we check if the command is part of the list of commands we have. If it is, we
create a new command object, fill in the name and arguments, and add it to the chapter object.

We also do something special if it is a `@include` command. For these ones, we take the file
read it, and parse it as a chapter (using the `parseChapter` function). Then we add the
included chapter's sections to the current chapter's sections. In this case, we don't add
the `@include` command to the list of chapter commands.

--- Parse a command
if (line.split().length > 1) {
    if (commands.canFind(line.split()[0])) {
        Command cmd = new Command();
        cmd.name = line.split()[0];
        auto index = cmd.name.length;
        cmd.args = strip(line[index..$]);
        cmd.lineNum = lineNum;
        cmd.filename = filename;
        if (cmd.args == "none") {
            cmd.args = "";
        }

        if (cmd.name == "@include") {
            Line[] includedLines;
            string fileSrc = readall(File(cmd.args));
            foreach (includedLineNum, includedLine; fileSrc.split("\n")) {
                auto includedLineObj = new Line(includedLine, cmd.args, cast(int) includedLineNum + 1);
                includedLines ~= includedLineObj;
            }
            if (includedLines.length > 0) {
                lines = lines[0 .. lineNum] ~ includedLines ~ lines[lineNum .. $];
            }
        }

        if (curSection is null) {
            chapter.commands ~= cmd;
        } else {
            curSection.commands ~= cmd;
        }
    }
}
---

Parsing an `@title` command is even simpler - with one caveat: in books, titles can be set in the table of contents, and then reset in the chapter file. To avoid any confusion, we warn where we can detect that the title has already been set, and add a hint if we're currently in a book.

--- Parse a title command
if (startsWith(line, "@title")) {
    if (chapter.title != "") {
        auto warning = ["found a @title command when the title has already been set"];
        if (isBook) {
            warning ~= ["perhaps the title is set in the table of contents?"];
        }
        warn(filename, lineNum, warning);   
    }
    chapter.title = strip(line[6..$]);
}
---

@s Parsing a Section Definition

When a new section is created (using `@s`), we should add the current section to the list
of sections for the chapter, and then we should create a new section, which becomes the
current section.

--- Parse a section definition
else if (startsWith(line, "@s")) {
    if (curBlock !is null && !curBlock.isCodeblock) {
        if (strip(curBlock.text()) != "") {
            curSection.blocks ~= curBlock;
        }
    } else if (curBlock !is null && curBlock.isCodeblock) {
        error(curBlock.startLine.file, curBlock.startLine.lineNum, "Unclosed block {" ~ curBlock.name ~ "}");
    }
    // Make sure the section exists
    if (curSection !is null) {
        chapter.sections ~= curSection;
    }
    curSection = new Section();
    curSection.title = strip(line[2..$]);
    curSection.commands = chapter.commands ~ curSection.commands;
    curSection.num = ++sectionNum;

    curBlock = new Block();
    curBlock.isCodeblock = false;
}
---

@s Parse the Start of a Codeblock

Codeblocks always begin with `--- title`, so we can use the regex `^---.+` to represent this.
Once a new codeblock starts, the old one must be appended to the current section's list of
blocks, and the current codeblock must be reset.

--- Parse the beginning of a code block
else if (matchAll(line, regex("^---.+"))) {
    if (curSection is null) {
        error(chapter.file, lineNum, "You must define a section with @s before writing a code block");
        continue;
    }

    if (curBlock !is null) {
        curSection.blocks ~= curBlock;
    }
    curBlock = new Block();
    curBlock.startLine = lineObj;
    curBlock.isCodeblock = true;
    curBlock.name = strip(line[3..$]);

    @{Parse Modifiers}

    if (blocks.canFind(curBlock.name)) {
        if (!curBlock.modifiers.canFind(Modifier.redef) && !curBlock.modifiers.canFind(Modifier.additive)) {
            error(filename, lineNum, "Redefinition of {" ~ curBlock.name ~ "}, use ':=' to redefine");
        }
    } else {
        blocks ~= curBlock.name;
    }

    foreach (cmd; curSection.commands) {
        if (cmd.name == "@code_type") {
            curBlock.codeType = cmd.args;
        } else if (cmd.name == "@comment_type") {
            curBlock.commentString = cmd.args;
        }
    }

    inCodeblock = true;
}
---

@s Check for and extract modifiers.

Modifier format for a code block: `--- Block Name --- noWeave +=`.
The `checkForModifiers` ugliness is due to lack of `(?|...)` and friends.

First half matches for expressions *with* modifiers:

1. `(?P<namea>\S.*)` : Keep taking from the first non-whitespace character ...
2. `[ \t]-{3}[ \t]` : Until it matches ` --- `
3. `(?P<modifiers>.+)` : Matches everything after the separator.

Second half matches for no modifiers: Ether `Block name` and with a floating separator `Block Name ---`.

1. `|(?P<nameb>\S.*?)` : Same thing as #1 but stores it in `nameb`
2. `[ \t]*?` : Checks for any amount of whitespace (Including none.)
3. `(-{1,}$` : Checks for any floating `-` and verifies that nothing else is there untill end of line.
4. `|$))` : Or just checks that there is nothing but the end of the line after the whitespace.

Returns ether `namea` and `modifiers` or just `nameb`. 

--- Parse Modifiers
auto checkForModifiers = ctRegex!(`(?P<namea>\S.*)[ \t]-{3}[ \t](?P<modifiers>.+)|(?P<nameb>\S.*?)[ \t]*?(-{1,}$|$)`);
auto splitOnSpace = ctRegex!(r"(\s+)");
auto modMatch = matchFirst(curBlock.name, checkForModifiers);

// matchFirst returns unmatched groups as empty strings

if (modMatch["namea"] != "") {
    curBlock.name = modMatch["namea"];
} else if (modMatch["nameb"] != ""){
    curBlock.name = modMatch["nameb"];
    // Check for old syntax.
    if (curBlock.name.endsWith("+=")) {
        curBlock.modifiers ~= Modifier.additive;
        curBlock.name = strip(curBlock.name[0..$-2]);
    } else if (curBlock.name.endsWith(":=")) {
        curBlock.modifiers ~= Modifier.redef;
        curBlock.name = strip(curBlock.name[0..$-2]);
    }
} else {
    error(filename, lineNum, "Something went wrong with: " ~ curBlock.name);
}

if (modMatch["modifiers"]) {
    foreach (m; splitter(modMatch["modifiers"], splitOnSpace)) {
        switch(m) {
            case "+=":
                curBlock.modifiers ~= Modifier.additive;
                break;
            case ":=":
                curBlock.modifiers ~= Modifier.redef;
                break;
            case "noWeave":
                curBlock.modifiers ~= Modifier.noWeave;
                break;
            case "noTangle":
                curBlock.modifiers ~= Modifier.noTangle;
                break;
            case "noHeader":
                curBlock.modifiers ~= Modifier.noHeader;
                break;
            default:
                error(filename, lineNum, "Invalid modifier: " ~ m);
                break;
        }
    }

}
---

@s Parse the End of a Codeblock

Codeblocks end with just a `---`. When a codeblock ends, we do the same as when it begins,
except the new block we create is a block of prose as opposed to code.

--- Begin a new prose block
if (curBlock !is null) {
    curSection.blocks ~= curBlock;
}
curBlock = new Block();
curBlock.startLine = lineObj;
curBlock.isCodeblock = false;
inCodeblock = false;
---

@s Add the current line

Finally, if the current line is nothing interesting, we just add it to the current block's
list of lines.

--- Add the line to the list of lines
curBlock.lines ~= new Line(line, filename, lineNum);
---

Now we're done parsing the line.

@s Closing the last section

When the end of the file is reached, the last section has not been closed and added to the
chapter yet, so we should do that. Additionally, if the last block is a prose block, it should
be closed and added to the section first. If the last block is a code block, it should have been
closed with `---`. If it wasn't we'll throw an error.

--- Close the last section
if (curBlock !is null) {
    if (!curBlock.isCodeblock) {
        curSection.blocks ~= curBlock;
    } else {
        error(filename, cast (int)(lines.length - 1), "{%s} is never closed".format(curBlock.name));
    }
}
if (curSection !is null) {
    chapter.sections ~= curSection;
}
---

@s Parsing the change block

Parsing a change block is somewhat complex. Change blocks look like this:

    @change file.lit
    
    Some comments here...
    
    @replace
    replace this text
    @with
    with this text
    @end
    
    More comments ...
    
    @replace
    ...
    @with
    ...
    @end
    
    ...
    
    @change_end

You can make multiple changes on one file. We've got two nice flags for keeping track of
which kind of block we are in: replaceText or searchText.

--- Parse change block
